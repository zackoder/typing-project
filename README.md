"I have a strong passion for memorizing song lyrics and improving my typing speed. To achieve this goal, I have decided to create a website dedicated to helping me accomplish both objectives. This website will serve as a platform for me to practice typing the lyrics of songs I enjoy, allowing me to commit them to memory while simultaneously enhancing my typing skills."
i want to count how many characters are right and how many are false but i think because of foreache loop it doesn't work.
A and i didn't set the timer, i'll set it soon
